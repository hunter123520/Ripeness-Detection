# Overcoming the Challenge of Vegetables and Fruits Ripeness Detection Using Deep Learning Based Methods

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of deep learning models for detecting the ripeness of vegetables and fruits. This project was presented at the 4th BÄ°LSEL International SUMELA Scientific Research Congress in Trabzon, Turkey.

**Key Features:**

* **Deep Learning:** Advanced techniques for accurate ripeness detection.
* **Image Analysis:** Processing and analyzing images of fruits and vegetables.
* **Ripeness Classification:** Categorizing fruits and vegetables based on ripeness level.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/hunter123520/Ripeness-Detection]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the notebook:** Open **Ripeness Detection.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
